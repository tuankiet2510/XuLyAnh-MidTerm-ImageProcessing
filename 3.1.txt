Ex 3.1: Color balance. Write a simple application to change the color balance of an image
by multiplying each color value by a different user-specified constant. If you want to get
fancy, you can make this application interactive, with sliders.
1. Do you get different results if you take out the gamma transformation before or after
doing the multiplication? Why or why not?
2. Take the same picture with your digital camera using different color balance settings
(most cameras control the color balance from one of the menus). Can you recover what
the color balance ratios are between the different settings? You may need to put your
camera on a tripod and align the images manually or automatically to make this work.
Alternatively, use a color checker chart (Figure 10.3b), as discussed in Sections 2.3 and
10.1.1.
3. Can you think of any reason why you might want to perform a color twist (Section 3.1.2) on the images? See also Exercise 2.9 for some related ideas
